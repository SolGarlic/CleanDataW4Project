# CleanDataW4Project
Coursera project

##This project cleans and tidies the data described in codebook.txt:

It has 4 files:  
* run_Analysis.R    code for creating the tidydataset.txt  
* README.md         this file that describes the project  
* codebook.txt      original file that described the dataset, updated with this project's changes  
* tidydataset.txt   the dataset created from the original information by the submitted code that performs the operations described below  

##Cleaning and tidying operations performed on the data:

First it just reads the features and labels.

Then, for each of the training and test sets, the code:  
1. Reads the X, Y and subject data  
2. Changes the column names, for X acording to features.  
3. Joins the three data.frames in a single named data.frame

It then joins (rbind) the training and testing datasets and, on the whole data set:  
1. Removes the columns with duplicate names to be able to process the next steps without errors.  
2. Selects only the columns x_total,activity,subject, and all the others that contain either mean or std.  
3. Creates a factor on the first column using the labels from the activity_labels.  

The last step is to summarize by the means of activity and subject (grouping first), and exporting the tidydataset.txt
